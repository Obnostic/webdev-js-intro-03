Explain why a number data type added to a string data type returns a string.
	Once the variable is established as a string in the 'let' or 'const' assignments, all future assignments
	will be converted into string.

Name a scenario where using the == operator could cause a bug.
	mixing object and primitive operands
	comparing operands of unequal data types

Name the operator(s) that you find confusing and explain why.
	&& doesn't return a boolean result, it only returns the value of the last true operand
	= assignment, == comparison === strict comparison

Explain a situation where you would use the Modulus operator and why.
	If I wanted to assign the result to a seperate variable
	If I wanted to check if the variable would remain an integer  (if result = 0)
	If I wanted to demonstrate long division
	If I wanted to control rounding an integer up or down by establishing a threshhold to the remainder
	If I wanted to check a numerical value before deciding to reassign the contents of an integer value to floating point
